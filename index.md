# About
------
Hi, I am Jiahua Chen (Ella, 陈佳桦 in Chinese). Now I am a software engineer in [Meituan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meituan){:target="_blank"}, my job is to test security strategies to protect the lives of millions of riders and use AI models to build intelligent assistants to recommend actions that internal employees want to use. Previously, I completed my master’s degree at Peking University, advised by Prof. [Ke Xu](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1126/3581.htm){:target="_blank"}. And my bachelor’s degree at [Xidian University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xidian_University){:target="_blank"}.
